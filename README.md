This is a pseudo-randomly generated 2d dungeon generator, written entirely in Java. It randomly generates rooms with hallways connecting them, and features a character that can walk around and interact with objects in the world. Progress is saveable, so the game can be quit and resumed at the same point. The game also detects mouse position and returns information about the tile the cursor is hovering over.
